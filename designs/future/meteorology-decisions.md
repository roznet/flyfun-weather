# Meteorology Design Decisions

Decisions around weather signal interpretation that have meaningful meteorological
trade-offs. Written so that a domain expert can review the reasoning and suggest
improvements.

## 1. Ceiling derivation: DD vs NWP-adjusted cloud layers

**Date:** 2026-04-01
**Status:** Implemented (DD chosen)
**Context:** Discovered via an inconsistency bug where the advisory showed LIFR/IFR
at an airport while the cross-section showed nearly clear skies at the same location.

### Background

The system computes ceiling from two independent sources, then takes the lower
(more conservative):

1. **Sounding-derived ceiling** — analyse the vertical temperature/dewpoint
   profile from the NWP model output. Where the dewpoint depression is small
   enough, flag a cloud layer with a coverage category (FEW/SCT/BKN/OVC).
   The lowest BKN or OVC base becomes the ceiling. When that layer starts at
   the first pressure level (surface), the Lifting Condensation Level (LCL)
   is used as a more physical cloud-base estimate.

2. **NWP cloud diagnostics ceiling** — some models (GFS, ICON) output their own
   cloud base/ceiling from their internal cloud parameterization. This is a
   direct model product, not derived from the profile.

The reconciled ceiling is `min(sounding_ceiling, nwp_ceiling)`.

### The cloud layer pipeline

The sounding analysis produces cloud layers in two stages:

1. **DD cloud layers** — pure dewpoint-depression detection from the vertical
   profile. Coverage (FEW/SCT/BKN/OVC) is assigned based on layer thickness,
   dewpoint depression magnitude, and number of consecutive saturated levels.

2. **NWP-adjusted cloud layers** — the DD layers are modified using the model's
   own bulk cloud cover percentages (`cloud_cover_low_pct`, `cloud_cover_mid_pct`,
   `cloud_cover_high_pct`). This adjustment can both *reduce* and *increase*
   coverage:
   - DD found BKN but model says 16% low cloud → downgraded to FEW
   - DD found SCT but model says 100% low cloud → upgraded to OVC

The cross-section visualization renders the NWP-adjusted layers. The advisory
ceiling uses the DD layers.

### The decision

**`sounding_ceiling_ft` is computed from DD cloud layers (stage 1), not
NWP-adjusted cloud layers (stage 2).**

### Reasoning

1. **Signal independence** — `reconcile_ceiling = min(sounding, nwp)` is designed
   to compare two independent estimates. If the sounding estimate already
   incorporates NWP cloud percentages, the NWP signal is double-counted: once
   in the sounding ceiling (via coverage adjustment), once in the NWP diagnostic
   ceiling. This can produce phantom ceilings that neither pure source supports.

2. **Observed artifact** — in the triggering case (EFNU→EEKE, 2026-04-02), GFS
   at EEKE demonstrated this problem:
   - DD detected SCT at 374ft (not enough moisture for BKN)
   - NWP `cloud_cover_low_pct` = 100% → coverage upgraded to OVC
   - LCL correction applied → ceiling = 1555ft (MVFR)
   - NWP diagnostic ceiling = 6348ft
   - Reconciled = min(1555, 6348) = 1555ft
   - This 1555ft ceiling was a hybrid artifact: DD alone would give 3179ft
     (BKN higher up), NWP alone would give 6348ft. Neither source predicted
     a 1555ft ceiling.

3. **Consistency** — the airport conditions code (`_ceiling_from_sounding()`)
   already used DD cloud layers for its fallback path. Having `sounding_ceiling_ft`
   use the NWP-adjusted version created a divergence where the same sounding
   could report different ceilings depending on code path.

4. **Serialization integrity** — DD cloud layers were not serialized to JSON
   (excluded to save space). On reload, they were reconstructed from the
   NWP-adjusted layers, losing the original DD coverage. This meant
   advisory results could change after a save/load cycle.

### What we decided against

**Using NWP-adjusted cloud layers for `sounding_ceiling_ft`** (the previous
behaviour).

Arguments that favoured this approach:

1. **Implicit false-alarm suppression** — for ECMWF, which lacks NWP cloud
   diagnostic output in our pipeline, there is no second estimate to reconcile
   with. The NWP cloud percentage adjustment was the only check on DD
   over-prediction. In the triggering case, ECMWF at EEKE had:
   - DD: BKN at 364ft (moist boundary layer)
   - `cloud_cover_low_pct` = 16% → NWP adjustment downgraded to FEW
   - Old behaviour: no BKN/OVC → `sounding_ceiling_ft` = None → VFR
   - New behaviour: BKN at 364ft → LCL correction → 920ft → IFR
   - If the 16% cloud cover is correct, the old result (VFR) was closer to
     reality and the new result (IFR) is a false alarm.

2. **More conservative in some cases** — the signal mixing could produce lower
   ceilings than either pure source (as in the GFS 1555ft case), which
   happened to be the cautious choice.

3. **DD over-prediction is a known issue** — a small dewpoint depression can
   reflect stable moist air that is not lifting to form cloud, or where
   turbulent mixing suppresses condensation. The model's cloud parameterization
   accounts for subgrid processes that a simple saturation diagnostic does not.

### Why we chose DD anyway

The old behaviour was accidental — it was conservative in some cases (ECMWF)
but created phantom ceilings in others (GFS). The conservatism was a side effect
of signal mixing, not a deliberate design choice. Better to have clean, predictable
logic and address the gaps explicitly:

- **ECMWF gap**: pending access to ECMWF full-precision GRIB data, which would
  provide cloud diagnostic ceiling as a proper second estimate.
- **Potential enhancement**: use `cloud_cover_low_pct` as an explicit third signal
  in `reconcile_ceiling()` rather than baking it into the sounding estimate.
  For example, if `cloud_cover_low_pct > 80%` and DD found any cloud near the
  surface (even SCT/FEW), that could inform the ceiling independently.

### Real-world validation needed

The triggering flight is EFNU→EEKE on 2026-04-02. Comparing METARs at EEKE
against the model predictions would ground-truth which approach was closer to
reality. Key questions:

- Did EEKE actually have low ceilings around 11Z? (DD prediction)
- Or was it clear/scattered as ECMWF's cloud scheme suggested?
- Did GFS's 100% low cloud verify, or was it a model bias?

### Files changed

- `src/weatherbrief/analysis/sounding/__init__.py` — `sounding_ceiling_ft`
  now computed from `dd_cloud_layers`
- `src/weatherbrief/tasks/artifacts.py` — `dd_cloud_layers` and
  `icing_ogimet_dd_zones` now serialized to `route_analyses.json`
- `src/weatherbrief/models/analysis.py` — comment update reflecting
  serialization change
